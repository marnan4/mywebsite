<div id="me">
    <p>Hello, I'm maruf, a rising senior at Queens Gateway Health Sciences. I'm currently
        a student at All Star Code, and I am loving it. I wanna become an accomplished 
        software developer with his own tech company even though that probably
        won't happen. I'm currently an apprentice at vendettasportsmedia, and you 
        find company's website by clicking on the picture of my idol, Muhammed Ali, right
        here.========================================>
        <br>
        I've published a couple articles here, so if you search hard enough, 
        you might find a few of my articles. 
    </p>
